# F1 Data Analytics App:
## Overview
An application for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing Formula 1 race weekend data. The project will be using FastF1 and Ergast API to get lap times, telemetry, and race data, then provide detailed insights such as:
- Predicted race pace from practice sessions
- Optimal qualifying laps (best sector combinations)
- Post-race summaries (pace deltas, pit strategy, tire performance)
The goal is to build an interactive platform to make analyzing F1 session data accessible and engaging.

## Features
- [] Fetch and cache session data.
- [] Display driver lap times and pace trends.
- [] Calculate driver's optimal lap from best sectors
- [] Compare race pace across drivers and stints
- [] Summarize pit strategy and tire usage
- [] Build an interactive front end. 
- [] Add predictive models for race outcomes.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, FastF1, FastAPI
- **APIs**: FastF1, Ergast API
- **Data Handling**: TBD
- **Visualization**: TBD
